                    <p>9.1 To be eligible to win a prize or a bonus or benefits, You must be a resident of India and
                        accessing the Services from within any part of India other than the Barred States. If You are
                        not a citizen of India, but access the services from within a permitted location in India, You
                        will be able to use our Services and win prizes or bonuses, and We will process Your Withdrawal
                        Requests in Indian Rupees to any Indian Bank Account in Your name (subject to KYC verification).
                    </p>
                    <p>9.2 When You add cash to the Deposit Segment, You may be allotted certain bonuses or benefits
                        depending on the ongoing promotional offer. Such bonuses or benefits may be dependent on certain
                        conditions, such as Your continued usage of Our Services or participation in Cash Games, and
                        accordingly, a part of the bonus may be released after every qualifying Game You play till the
                        time the whole bonus has been credited to the Deposit Segment. You understand that the bonus
                        must be earned (disbursed) within the stipulated claim period, which may differ based on the
                        ongoing offers. Bonuses are issued at Our sole discretion and cannot be claimed by You as a
                        matter of right. The release percentage/rate may vary depending on the offer. Bonus shall have
                        such limited validity as may be communicated to You at the time of its issuance.</p>
                    <p>For example – If You are awarded Rs.100 bonus and You play a qualifying Game of Rs. 200, where
                        10% of Rs.200 (where 10% is the percentage release being available as part of the ongoing
                        offer), i.e., Rs.20 bonus would be credited to Your table balance. If You play the next game of
                        Rs.500 within the offer period, then 10% of Rs.500, i.e. Rs.50 bonus would be credited to Your
                        table balance. This will continue till the whole bonus amount is released. </p>
                    <p>9.3 In the event, Your FreeKey11 Account is terminated by You voluntarily or by Us in accordance
                        with these Terms, all bonuses and benefits issued to You shall be forfeited by Us and You shall
                        have no right or interest on such bonus. </p>

                        receiving the bonus and benefits.</p>

                        of the Platform by the user, including the frequency of Games played, participation in
